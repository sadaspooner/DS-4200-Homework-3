            <h2>Why I Love Cooking</h2>
            <p>My favorite cuisine is undoubtedly Italian. From pasta to pizza, the simplicity of fresh ingredients combined with bold flavors has always captivated me. Over the years, I’ve delved deep into this cuisine, experimenting with homemade sauces, dough, and traditional dishes. I feel like I’ve truly mastered it, but cooking is always a journey, and with that mastery came a curiosity to explore new flavors. This curiosity led me to branch out into various Asian cuisines. </p>
            <p>Recently, I tried making Pho for the first time, and I was thrilled with how the flavors came together. I also tested out making Satay, experimenting with different marinades and grilling techniques. These recent cooking projects have reignited my passion for exploring new ingredients and methods. They’ve also inspired me to try more Asian restaurants to further expand my understanding of the cuisine. </p>
            <p>Outside of my love for food, I have a big interest in fitness and nutrition. To support my fitness goals, particularly hitting my macros, I focus heavily on high-protein foods. I make an effort to incorporate whole foods, rather than relying on artificial protein sources. When I go grocery shopping, I prioritize fresh chicken, turkey, steak, and fish, as well as grains and vegetables. This focus on whole foods has shifted my perspective on cooking, making me more mindful of the ingredients I use and how they fuel my body. </p>
